Fourth and final project of the third (of four) modules at Turing School of Software & Design. This project will have a completed JavaScript front end by 01-28-2019. 

## Objective

The objective of this app is to create API endpoints for a JavaScript front end to consume. The app consumes the Google Geocode API and the DarkSky API to then output six endpoints for current weather for an authorized user.
